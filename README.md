## Workshop-claofun

Prerequisite | 
------------ | 
Install testem library. Run this command in your terminal: `npm install testem -g` |

---

- Best to start solving from **pre-work-workshops** folder thus is the easiest one 
- Then move on to upper folders (loops, objects, arrays etc)


---

### Directions:

1. Run testem from each directory.
2. Copy and paste the url into a browser.
3. For each question, read the README, and then write your code in the .js
   file in each directory.
4. Save your work to update the tests. See result in browser or in terminal.
5. Green means passed, red means failed.
